  <h1 class="post-title">Universal Design for Web</h1>
  <span class="post-date">11 Aug 2014</span>
  <p>The term &quot;universal design&quot; was coined by the architect <a href="http://www.ncsu.edu/ncsu/design/cud/about_us/usronmace.htm">Ronald L. Mace</a> to
describe the concept of designing all products and the built environment to be
aesthetic and usable to the greatest extent possible by everyone, regardless of their age,
ability, or status in life.</p>

<p>For web universal design is about providing accessibility to all, even when those people&#39;s
abilities are limited in some way. Often the first thought when talking about accessibility
that comes to mind is &quot;assistive technology&quot; like screen readers, though it is part of the
accessible to all eco-system its definitely not whole of it. Accessibility can be as simple
as the capability of changing the font size of the article you are reading, like this one.</p>

<p>Accessibility rather being an afterthought and should be included in the process as early as
possible and here is how you can achieve it.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t just try to achieve compliance try to really achieve access to all. Section 508 in US was
last updated in year 2000 and WCAG 2.0 in 2008. Only being complaint to them might not mean your
site is fully accessible as the web has moved on since then.</p>

<h3>During Design</h3>

<p>Create accessibility personas for as part of the design process. You can get tips and some example
<a href="http://diveintoaccessibility.info/by_person.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>Add Notes to your doodles and wireframes showing thoughts on it would work for different situtaions. Don&#39;t confuse accessibility to usability, if something is not accessible to
someone it sure won&#39;t be usable.</p>

<h3>During Development</h3>

<p>Delve into the WC3&#39;s ARIA guidelines, don&#39;t just limit your self to the last updated version.
Check what is in the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wcag">pipeline today</a> for a more updated document.
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility">MDN</a> also maintains upto date documentation and curated collection of articles to help build for
today and the future.</p>

<p>Add test for accessibility in your code itself. You can use <a href="">sass</a> as a pre-processor and write checks for color contrast to be always above a certain threshold. Here is <a href="https://github.com/ornament-design/sass-color">snippet of code</a> to achieve it.</p>

<p>You can even take rules from tools like <a href="https://github.com/Heydon/REVENGE.CSS">revenge.css</a> and package it for your editor to do validation on the fly. <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a> also you to include such plugable code linter.</p>

<h3>Post Build Checks</h3>

<p>Add some continous integration tool to your build process which should allow you to run w3c
validators as well some other tools like <a href="https://github.com/GoogleChrome/accessibility-developer-tools">Google Accessibility Developer Tools</a> and <a href="http://achecker.ca/checker/index.php">AChecker</a> on a on going basis to help identify and issues early in the process. Use a header less browser like <a href="http://phantomjs.org/">phantomjs</a> to run them on your server.</p>

<h3>Testing the application</h3>

<p>Start with a text only browser <a href="http://lynx.browser.org/">lynx</a> as the first check point.
Then move to a screen reader, you can use <a href="http://www.chromevox.com/">chrome vox</a> which is a
screen reader for chrome or <a href="http://www.apple.com/accessibility/osx/voiceover/">Voice Over</a> for mac.</p>

<h3>Open Web Community Support</h3>

<p>Since you are such a champ that your taking the time and effort to make your product accessible to
all you get a lot of help from the community. Take a look at <a href="http://a11yproject.com/">A11Y Project</a> which provides you with a widget pattern library, checklist for your HTML and plenty of good other resources as well.</p>

<h3>Thank You!</h3>

<p>With more than <a href="http://www.un.org/disabilities/default.asp?id=18">1 billion people</a> in the world
living with an impairment be assured someone somewhere is thanking you for your effort.</p>
